        <p>I have a two node SQLServer fail over clustered instance configured, how many licenses do I need to monitor the cluster?</p>
        <p>You need two (2) (licenses) for the active and the standby node.</p>
        <p>This is also applicable to AlwaysOn High Availability Groups.  How do you license Oracle container and pluggable databases?</p>
        <p>For full monitoring you will need a license for the container, and one extra license per pluggable database.</p>
        <p>An example: if you have 2 container databases and 5 pluggable databases, you will need a total of seven/7 dbWatch Control Center licenses to monitor those Oracle container/pluggable databases.</p>
